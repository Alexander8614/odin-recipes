    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food consisting of fillings —usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll..​</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <Ul>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to make thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese onto each of four of the patties. Top each of the patties with cheese with one of the patties without; press the edges together to seal the cheese into the center.</li>
        <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    </Ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat grill to medium heat.</li>
        <li> In a small skillet combine the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and put over low heat. Add the poultry seasoning while stirring constantly; when sauce mixes well and starts to bubble, it is done.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on hot grill and brush with sauce. Grill for 45 to 60 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, and brush chicken with sauce after each turning. Grill until chicken is done and juices run clear. (Note: Be sure to keep an eye on the chicken as it cooks, as it tends to have flair ups due to the oil and chicken drippings!)</li>
    </ol>
