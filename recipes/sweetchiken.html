    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sweet and sour chicken is a dish or appetizer typical of Chinese-American cuisine. The chicken is essentially white meat chicken strips battered and deep fried. Unlike sweet and sour pork, this dish has no equivalent in Chinese cuisine, being almost exclusive to North America, although it is also frequently found in Chinese restaurants in other parts of the world. It is usually served with sweet and sour sauce, sometimes accompanied by pineapple, green bell pepper or cherry.​</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <Ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>2 pounds cut up chicken pieces</li>
    </Ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat grill to medium heat.</li>
        <li> In a small skillet combine the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and put over low heat. Add the poultry seasoning while stirring constantly; when sauce mixes well and starts to bubble, it is done.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on hot grill and brush with sauce. Grill for 45 to 60 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, and brush chicken with sauce after each turning. Grill until chicken is done and juices run clear. (Note: Be sure to keep an eye on the chicken as it cooks, as it tends to have flair ups due to the oil and chicken drippings!)</li>
    </ol>
