    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna (Italian: lasagna) is a type of pasta. It is usually served in overlapping sheets interspersed with layers of ingredients to taste, most often meat (ragù) in Bolognese sauce and béchamel sauce. Its origin is Italian and the dish, usually prepared with meat, is often called baked lasagna.1</p>
    <p>Baked lasagna can also be made with vegetables (spinach, eggplant, etc.) or fish.2 It is finished with béchamel sauce and plenty of grated cheese for baking au gratin in the oven. The word "lasagna" comes from the Greek "lasanon", through the Latin "lasanum", which refers to the pot in which it was cooked.</p>
